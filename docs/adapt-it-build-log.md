# Adapt-It — overnight build log

Durable state for the autonomous overnight run (survives context compaction). Newest facts win.
Plan: `docs/plans/2026-07-11-adapt-it-saas-plan.md` · North star: `docs/plans/adapt-it-design-northstar.md`

## Where I am
- Worktree: `/Users/love/Developer/bme-adapt-it` · branch `adapt-it` (tracks origin/main, based 440191c).
- node_modules symlinked to main repo (disk is tight, ~2.8GB free). `.env.local` copied.
- Infra verified LIVE: Anthropic key (Haiku responded), Supabase DB (13 practices). Machine caffeinated.

## Phase status
- **P1 data foundation — ✅ DONE, verified.** `workspaces` table (additive migration `0009`, applied; practices still 13). `src/workspace/{schema,default,store,active}.ts`. `getActiveWorkspace()` → `{id,slug,name,config}`, falls back to synthetic EliseAI default. Seed script ran (`eliseai` row exists). 12 tests + full suite green.
- **P2 runtime theming — ✅ DONE, verified.** One runtime CSS-var override re-skins 100% of surface. 4 JS-hex gradients + StatRing promoted to `--gradient-*` / `var(--color-*)` tokens (parity test green). `design/brand.ts` `brandVars(brand)` (28 vars, pure/SSR-safe). `design/brand-provider.tsx` (`BrandProvider`, `useBrand`). Product name/wordmark from active workspace. Login restyled onto the kit. Full suite 1072 pass.
- **P3 AI Adapter onboarding — ✅ DONE, verified (incl. real Claude smoke).** `app/adapt/*` (welcome→who→ICP→buying-moment→proof→brand→reveal), `src/adapt/*`, routes `POST /api/adapt/generate` (`{companyName,whatYouSell,websiteUrl?}`→`{config,source}`) + `POST /api/adapt/finalize` (`{config}`→`{slug}`, persists + sets active cookie). Live preview via `brandVars`. Login entry point added. 12 adapt tests + suites green. Real freight-broker smoke: green palette, 3 signals, 3 sample prospects.
- **P4 adapted dashboard + Customization Studio — ✅ DONE, verified (tsc + suite + fresh-eyes review).** Feed/brief/scoreboard branch on `id === "default"`: default keeps the practices feed, `/practice/[id]`, and the real roi_events scoreboard UNCHANGED. A tenant (`id !== "default"` + `sampleFeed.length > 0`) gets `app/tenant-feed.tsx` (sample prospects, ranked by signal count, signal filter + name search), `app/prospect/[id]` → `app/prospect/[id]/sample-brief-view.tsx` (two-tier at-a-glance / call-prep, 404-graceful when id missing or default), and `app/tenant-scoreboard-view.tsx` (honest "fills in as you work leads" state — never EliseAI's global roi_events). `app/customize` = the studio (`customize-studio.tsx`): brand (live `brandVars` preview), signals, pitch, proof (proven/pending union), audience; holds the FULL config and posts it whole to `POST /api/workspace/update`, which resolves the active workspace server-side, refuses the default (409), Zod-validates (422), then `updateWorkspaceConfig`; on 200 the studio `router.refresh()` re-skins the app. Default id → read-only "adapt first" state. `app/sample-signal-pill.tsx` renders a tenant's free-form signal name in a promoted signal gradient (stable name hash). "Customize" added to TopNav. Full suite 1088 pass + 4 new route-contract tests (`tests/workspace/update-route.test.ts`). Did NOT touch `app/adapt/**` or `app/api/adapt/**`.
- **P5 landing + Jobs-caliber visual pass — ⏳ PENDING.** Front door, surface differentiation, elevation/materiality, motion, empty states.

## Key contracts (so phases integrate cleanly)
- Active workspace: `getActiveWorkspace()` in `src/workspace/active.ts`. Cookie `active_workspace` = slug.
- Config shape: `WorkspaceConfig` in `src/workspace/schema.ts` (brand, business, signals[], pitch, proof[], sampleFeed[]).
- Theme preview: `brandVars(partialBrand)` (`design/brand.ts`) → spread onto a container `style`, or wrap in `<BrandProvider>`.
- P4 feed contract: if active slug is not `eliseai`/`default` and `config.sampleFeed.length > 0`, render sampleFeed; else render the existing practices feed.

## Auth finding (verified 2026-07-11)
- App is NOT globally auth-gated: no middleware, no auth in `app/layout.tsx` / `app/page.tsx`. Read
  pages (feed, prospect, scoreboard, customize) render freely. Only MUTATIONS use `guardMutation`
  (allowlist): send email, feedback, HubSpot connect. `POST /api/workspace/update` and the adapt
  routes are NOT allowlist-gated (they resolve the active workspace server-side).
- Therefore the whole brand-new-tenant path works cookie-based with NO login wall:
  `/welcome` → `/adapt` → reveal (sets cookie) → `/` → `/prospect/[id]` → `/customize` (save works) → `/scoreboard`.
- Real per-tenant auth (a signup that issues a tenant session) = documented roadmap, not tonight.
- Dev server: MUST run `npx next dev --webpack` (the node_modules symlink crashes Turbopack). Never `next build` (disk).

## FINAL STATUS — shipped 2026-07-11
- **SHIPPED** to `origin/adapt-it` (5 commits, based on origin/main 440191c). Never touched main.
- SCOPE -> BUILD -> VERIFY -> REVIEW -> SHIP all complete.
- **Verified e2e in a real browser** as a brand-new non-healthcare tenant ("Northbeam", an HR onboarding
  platform): welcome -> AI onboarding (real Claude, HR-tailored signals, zero healthcare bleed) -> reveal
  -> branded feed -> brief in their voice -> Customize teal re-skin (whole app repainted) -> honest scoreboard.
  Zero console errors. 13 screenshots in the session scratchpad `e2e/`.
- **Full test suite green: 1104 passed, 0 failed** (+ the pre-existing PDL env-leak flake only if you
  source .env.local into the shell before vitest). tsc clean. Token parity green.
- **Fresh-eyes review passed**, security model confirmed sound (no forged-cookie path to EliseAI real data).
  Two confirmed bugs fixed (signal-rename on removal; getActiveWorkspace DB-error fallback) + em-dash scrub.
- **Run it:** `cd /Users/love/Developer/bme-adapt-it && npx next dev --webpack` then open
  http://localhost:3000/welcome (Turbopack crashes on the symlinked node_modules; use --webpack).

## Security hardening (added after a background review of the pushed commits, 2026-07-11)
- A background security review flagged the `active_workspace` cookie as forgeable (gate-bypass in
  session.ts, cross-tenant IDOR read on `/prospect/[id]`, cross-tenant IDOR WRITE on
  `/api/workspace/update`). FIXED: the cookie is now a signed capability `slug.hmac` (HMAC-SHA256 with
  the existing `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, Web Crypto so it verifies in both Edge proxy and Node).
  `src/workspace/cookie-sign.ts` + verify in `session.ts` and `getActiveWorkspace()`. The server only
  ever mints a signature for the workspace a visitor just created, so a visitor can hold a valid cookie
  ONLY for their own workspace and cannot forge one for another slug. Verified live: valid signed cookie
  -> 200; forged bare cookie -> 307 denied on `/`, `/customize`, `/scoreboard`, and the update write. 7
  new tests (incl. the exact signature-reuse IDOR attempt). Full suite 1110 green.

## Roadmap (intentionally OUT of scope tonight, documented honestly)
- **True multi-tenant isolation (RLS + tenant_id on every entity table).** Tonight is config-level tenancy
  hardened by the signed cookie above: a visitor can only act as the workspace they created, and EliseAI
  real data stays allowlist-gated. Per-row RLS at the DB layer is still the right defense-in-depth for
  production (so isolation does not depend on the app layer alone).
- **Real signup auth** that issues a per-tenant session (today the tenant path is cookie-based, no account).
- **Live signal detection for arbitrary industries.** The sample feed is Claude-generated; the detector
  seams already accept injected queries, so wiring real Adzuna/GDELT/Places queries per industry is the next step.
- **Rate-limit /adapt + /api/adapt** (public, they spend Claude) before any public deploy.
- **Signal identity by stable id** (not denormalized name) so renames/removes never risk feed label drift.
- **Per-tenant BYOK key vault + per-tenant HubSpot connect** (today the single-instance connect stays).

## Discipline
- Phases run SEQUENTIALLY to avoid silent file collisions (autonomous, no human to catch a bad merge).
- Every phase: additive + reversible, EliseAI default path stays green, tsc passes, no `next build` (disk), no em dashes, no hidden errors.
- Verify = e2e in Claude Chrome as a brand-new B2B (non-healthcare) user, end of build.
- Ship = commit in tight chunks, push branch `adapt-it` to origin. NEVER main.
